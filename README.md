# 🎵 Alura MIDI - Virtual Instrument Web App

**Alura MIDI** is a personal project built as part of a JavaScript course from Alura.  
The goal was to create an interactive web app that plays musical instrument sounds when users interact with on-screen buttons or keyboard keys.

This project demonstrates DOM manipulation, event handling, responsive layout, and dynamic audio feedback.
